I feel like I had so many thoughts on Anathem and now I can't think of anything. It's only been like 4 days. 

One of the core ideas of the book that drew me in was this idea of a concent. There are Maths that contain different generations of sorts. There's 1 year, 10 year, 100 year, and 1000 year Maths. The number determines how often their gate is opened to the rest of the concent and the outside. The ten year math only opens once every 10 years during Apert. During these 10 days, the people of the Math are able to go out into the rest of the world as well as interact with any of the other Maths that gate has opened. 

The idea is that they are sheltered from the outside world's events for the time in between their aperts. The thousanders have people who are utilizng information from their last apert which could be hundreds of years prior or many lifetimes. The concents are sort of academic monestaries where they focus on education primarily. There is no religion or god worshipped, but the system itself. The priorities are pushing knowledge forward. They are self sufficient and have no time frames for anything.

This whole concept sounded weirdly utopic to me that I didn't acknowledge that they were forced into this situation of sorts and the word concent is derived from concentration camps. There are certainly negative aspects of it, like their lack of freedom and inability to reproduce. Their freedom to explore their mind, study, and work on things of their choosing is extremely interesting to me. They cook, socialize, and spend their life outside or in books. No jeejahs (cell phones) or screens in general. It sounds kind of idealic to me.


It's odd, because I'm interested in tech and tinkering with new things. Yet, there's something weirdly appealing about spending my whole life learning about myself and others. There's so much we don't really understand about the human condition, yet we race along regardless. I often feel like we're chasing dopamine when contentment is right at our feet. This is obviously not a new concept, but so far practice it especially at an extreme.

I've been working toward a balance. Having a job or some sort of income is necessary unless you're wealthy, but it's also a huge asset. There is something incredibly "real" about large groups of people and understanding your value in a system. THere's no more real system than one where people are willing to put their money where their mouth is with money. I don't think relying on donations makes a lot of sense. With that said, I think an ideal world would be 20-30 hours a week (depending on how much you value your job) so that you are an active member of society and produce an income. This leaves more time for you to focus on the knowledge and understanding that is valuable to you. 

A community is another aspect of this system that is very intriguing. I've been interested in communal living situations. After college and early in my career I always had roommates and lived in communal living situations. They have some obvious downasides, but there is some inherent benefit spending a great deal of time with people. Work is another example of this. There are a variety of ways to build communities like this, whether it's a close knit neighborhood, social groups, and roommates.
