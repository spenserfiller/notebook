# Understanding Text Generation in GPT Models: A Deep Dive

In this post, we’ll explore how GPT models generate text step-by-step. By decoding and breaking down how tokens are processed, passed through the model, and mapped back to vocabulary, we’ll answer some key questions about how GPT works under the hood.

## How GPT Generates Text

Text generation in GPT models is an **autoregressive process**, which means the model generates one token at a time, based on previously generated tokens. Here’s a simplified function for greedy text generation:

```python
def generate_text_simple(model, idx, max_new_tokens, context_size):
    for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
        # Trim the input to fit the model's context window
        idx_cond = idx[:, -context_size:]
        
        # Pass through the model (disable gradient calculation)
        with torch.no_grad():
            logits = model(idx_cond)
        
        # Focus on the last time step
        logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # Shape: (batch_size, vocab_size)
        
        # Convert logits to probabilities
        probas = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        
        # Pick the most likely next token (greedy decoding)
        idx_next = torch.argmax(probas, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
        
        # Append the new token to the input sequence
        idx = torch.cat((idx, idx_next), dim=1)
    
    return idx
```

### What’s Happening Here?
This function generates new tokens one by one using **greedy decoding**, where we always choose the most likely token at each step. Let’s break it down further:

1. **Trimming the Input Context:**
   ```python
   idx_cond = idx[:, -context_size:]
   ```
   GPT has a fixed context window. If the input sequence exceeds this size, we keep only the most recent tokens.

2. **Passing the Input Through the Model:**
   ```python
   logits = model(idx_cond)
   ```
   The model processes the input and outputs a set of **logits** for each token in the input sequence. Logits are raw scores that we’ll later convert to probabilities.

3. **Extracting the Last Token’s Logits:**
   ```python
   logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # Shape: (batch_size, vocab_size)
   ```
   Since we’re generating text autoregressively (one token at a time), we only care about the logits for the **last time step**.

4. **Converting Logits to Probabilities:**
   ```python
   probas = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
   ```
   The softmax function normalizes the logits into a **probability distribution** over the entire vocabulary.

5. **Selecting the Most Likely Token:**
   ```python
   idx_next = torch.argmax(probas, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
   ```
   This line picks the token with the highest probability (greedy decoding). The token ID is appended to the input sequence.

## Tokens, Embeddings, and Vocabulary: How It All Fits Together

### Step 1: From Token to Embedding
When we feed text into GPT, it’s first tokenized into subword units (e.g., "Hello world!" → `[620, 1567, 198]`), and then these token IDs are mapped to **embeddings**. Each embedding is a dense vector of size `d_model` (e.g., 768 for GPT-2 small).

### Step 2: Passing Embeddings Through Transformer Layers
The embeddings are passed through multiple transformer layers, which apply **self-attention**, **feedforward transformations**, and **normalization**. This enriches each token’s embedding with contextual information from the entire input sequence.

### Step 3: Mapping Hidden States to Logits
After the final transformer layer, the hidden states are mapped to a **logits vector** of size `vocab_size`. Each element in this vector represents the model’s score for a particular token in the vocabulary.

### Step 4: Converting Logits to Tokens
To generate the next token:
1. **Softmax** converts logits to probabilities.
2. We pick the most probable token (using greedy decoding, or alternatively, sampling techniques like top-k or nucleus sampling).

## Why Do We Pick a Token Instead of Directly Converting the Embedding?
This is a key insight! The model doesn’t directly output a token—it outputs a high-dimensional vector (logits) with scores for each token in the vocabulary. By selecting the token with the highest score, we pick the **closest match** in terms of meaning and context.

## Understanding the Vocabulary and Decoding Process
The vocabulary is implicitly referenced throughout the process:
- **Input tokens (`idx`)** are indices that map to specific vocabulary tokens.
- **Model outputs logits** that represent scores for every token in the vocabulary.
- **Final decoding step** converts logits to token IDs, which can then be converted back to text using a tokenizer.

## Visualization: Putting It All Together
Here’s a quick visualization of the key steps:

```
Input Text → Token IDs → Embeddings → Transformer Layers → Logits → Probabilities → Next Token
```

## Key Takeaways
1. **GPT generates text autoregressively**, one token at a time.
2. **Embeddings are processed through transformer layers**, which enrich them with contextual meaning.
3. **Logits are mapped to tokens using softmax and decoding methods** (like greedy decoding).
4. **The vocabulary is referenced implicitly through token IDs**, logits, and final decoding steps.

By understanding this flow, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for how GPT models generate coherent and contextually rich text. Whether you’re building your own transformer-based model or fine-tuning GPT, these fundamentals are essential.
