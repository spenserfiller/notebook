I've been following [Print Your Speakers](https://printyourspeakers.com) for a while and finally decided to take the plunge. The idea is that 3D printing allows for complex internal geometries (like spiraled transmission lines) that are impossible to manufacture with traditional woodworking.

## The Plan
1.  Select a design (likely the Spirula or similar).
2.  Source the drivers and crossover components.
3.  Print the cabinets in a rigid material (PLA+ or PETG with high infill).
4.  Assembly and testing.
