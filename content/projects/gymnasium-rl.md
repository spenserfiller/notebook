I'm currently working through the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org) documentation and implementing classic Reinforcement Learning algorithms from scratch (and with libraries like Stable Baselines3).

## Current Focus
*   **Algorithm:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
*   **Environment:** LunarLander-v2 and CartPole-v1

It is surprisingly challenging to tune the hyperparameters. The agent often gets stuck in local optima. I plan to write a full blog post breakdown of my PPO implementation once I get it consistently solving the harder environments.
