Kumiko is a traditional Japanese woodworking technique of assembling wooden pieces without nails. It's beautiful but incredibly time-consuming. I used 3D printing to replicate the aesthetic at a larger scale.

## Build Notes
I printed this on my Bambu Lab printer. The generator allows you to customize the grid size and pattern density. The main challenge was assembling the multiple printed plates into a cohesive 2x3 foot structure. It is a bit "janky" in places where the seams meet, but from a distance, the shadow lines look fantastic.

### Future Improvements
If I do this again, I would use a matte filament to better simulate wood texture and perhaps design a hidden bracket system for the back.
