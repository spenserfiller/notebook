- [Introduction to a Self Managed Life: a 13 hour & 28 minute presentation by FUTO software](https://wiki.futo.org/index.php/Introduction_to_a_Self_Managed_Life:_a_13_hour_%26_28_minute_presentation_by_FUTO_software) - Cool resource that Jacob shared. It goes into the depths of DIY networking related tools. Routers, own server, self managed email.. etc. Homesteading for computers

- [Open data golf launch monitor](https://openlaunch.io/products/nova-golf-entertainment-system) - I thought this was completely open source but I believe just the software/data is? Or maybe just the data? It's pretty cool, tho. You can control it with club movement which is pretty noval in the space.

- [Puffer AI - RL learning tool](https://puffer.ai/) - "PufferLib is a fast and sane reinforcement learning library that can train tiny, super-human models in seconds." I am thinking of using this as a start to get back into RL. It's kind of openAI gym combined with RL tools for easy exploration. Seems pretty cool. [Github](https://github.com/pufferai/pufferlib)

- [be your own algorithm](https://youtu.be/Bdj14_jdumI?si=n0r_yXVQcHyq2cyB) - This was pretty interesting. This was largely a discussion around the book "FilterWorld". It sounds like the author had many views that I've shared in the past. It felt like she was addressing me to some extent. I've been interested in the idea of be your own algorithm and resonate with much of her arguments. I might make this a longer post, but tldr: social media and content creators aren't inherently bad. There's tons of good stuff, better than ever before. It's the platforms that are toxic. The internet is still an amazing place.

- [The Paper Menagerie - Ken Liu](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5838a24729687f08e0321a15/t/5bf2bdfa562fa782871c6252/1542635003373/The-Paper-Menagerie+by+Ken+Liu.pdf) - This was mentioned by the next link "be your own algorithm". I haven't read it but it's a pretty short story about ai.

- [FilterWorld - Kyle Chayka](https://www.amazon.com/Filterworld-How-Algorithms-Flattened-Culture/dp/0385548281) - This was the focus on "be your own algorithm". Not sure I want to read based on the video, but seems interesting for discussions around social media, the internet, and culture

- [The internet is shit](https://theinternetisshit.xyz/) - a website that hosts a bunch of other small "tasteful" websites. 

- [The Indie Web](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieweb/) - This has been a reoccuring theme in my internet usage lately. Trying to stay off of the major platforms (facebook, instagram, x, etc..). My desire to build out my personal site has been largely based on this.

- [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) - This was shared by Jacob as well. Kind of like a coding bootcamp but you work on whatever you want. Sort of a guild of people who want social reinforcement for extended technical sabbaticals.

- [Bhagavad Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) - The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that forms part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. Presented as a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer, it explores profound themes of duty (dharma), righteous action, devotion, and self-realization. The Gita is revered as a spiritual and philosophical guide, offering insights into how to live a life of purpose, balance, and inner peace amid moral and emotional conflict.

- [Why Bored People Quit](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/) - A short article JC shared with me about how managers should help prevent burnout. Being bored isn't helpful for anyone. I am definitely bored at work.

- [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) - A massive project for providing various roadmaps to different technical tracks. I am interested in this for RL, but also the concept as a whole. I want to add another tab to this blog for my own skill-tree/track. Help give some visual representation for what I'm moving toward.

- [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) - A service that Jacob shared that aims to teach the core of software and computers. Understand it all.

- [Determined - Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determined:_A_Science_of_Life_Without_Free_Will) - I'm currently reading Behave by Sapolsky and this is another interesting one that I haven't read. Seems to be a biological approach to why we make decisions.

- [PiTrac Golf Launch Monitor](https://hackaday.io/project/195042/logs) - A completely open source launch monitor. Not sure it's worth the effort or not, but very cool. Could be a fun electronics project at some point. [Github](https://github.com/PiTracLM/PiTrac)

- [Lies of Locked Lamora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lies_of_Locke_Lamora) - Shane said one of his facorite books.

- [Kalypso llm](https://huggingface.co/IIEleven11/Kalypso) - A llm model with no guardrails. Praised for good story telling.

- [Sophia - Geoffrey](https://geoffreyducharme.substack.com/) - Some articles about the system written by one of my previous managers.
