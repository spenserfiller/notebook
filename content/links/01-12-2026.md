- [bifrost](https://www.getmaxim.ai/bifrost) - Interesting product, but mostly I like the designs on the page. Inspired me to do a redesign for this blog!

- [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org) - I've been implementing PPO on some gymnasium problems. It's pretty entertaining and challenging. I'll do a writeup on it soon hopefully.

- [Improvement of the Mind](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~sjreeves/cm/improve.html) - Interesting synopsis of Improvement of the Mind by Dr. Isaac Watts. Some intentional guidance for learning and being.

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) - Highly recommended RL textbook available for free online.

- [3D Printed Kumiko](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1614814-large-kumiko-frame-generator#profileId-1733448) - Another item I was hoping to make an article about. Using this, I created a 2x3' 3d printed kumiko. A little janky but pretty cool. It's a pretty amazing setup regardless.

- [3D Printed Speakers](https://printyourspeakers.com) - Now you can download a speaker instead of just your music! A project on my todo list.
